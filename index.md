## About

The Suntree Egyptian Goose Ornithological Society (SEGOS) was founded to support the enjoyment and study of Egyptian Geese and other birds living within the unincorporated community of Suntree, Florida. The organization was founded by a group of like-minded citizens passionate about the flourishment of such birds and the preservation of the wildlife living in and around Suntree for generations to come. 



## How to Support

To support SEGOS, please contact us using our contact form and tell us a bit about yourself! At the included email, you will be contacted in the future with information about in-person meetups, migration updates, and any other topics. 

## File a Complaint

If you encounter an individual who is not acting towards Egyptian Geese or other such birds with their best intersts in mind, so to speak, please utilize the contact form and detail the behavior of the human that you observed. This can be something as complicated as a City Council member's vote or as simple as littering. Thank you in advance for your committment to the well-being of our community's fowl.
